# React this.props.children Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice using the `React.Children` utilities
2. Explain how to use `this.props.children` to build reusable components

## Overview

Have students write containing components as well as use predefined components
to practice leveraging `this.props.children` and the `React.Children` API.

This should be a fairly straightforward lab — we can just build on the stuff
that we've covered in the reading — but as usual, it'll be A+ if we can frame
the students' work with a compelling framing narrative.
